# Weather-Journal App Project
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Overview

Please keep in mind while reviewing my code that my code is the result of practicing each lesson in the classroom 
and i write it in the same order as explained in the Development Strategy lesson in the class room
so my code might be similair to what i studied in the classroom.


## What I Modifyed
I modifyied the `index.html` file y adding two extra div with two id country and name for the country name and the cit name to show dynamically for each zip code the user will enter so hethe user will et an idea of which city and country this data is for.

I modifyed the `style.css` file. I changed:
  - the layout a bit.
  - also changed the fonts and background colors.
  - i changed the shape of the button by givin it rounded edges and added cursor: pointer; style to the mouse while havoring over it.
 

I modifyed the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file.
